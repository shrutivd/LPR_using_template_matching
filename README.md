WARNING: This application may run into errors with accuracy when running it on MacOS.
This is due to an issue with the glob library compatibility with MacOS.
If the license plate characters are being identified as mostly 1â€™s, try running on an MCECS Windows Remote Lab computer at https://intranet.cecs.pdx.edu/remote_lab/remotelab.php.
This should fix the issue.
